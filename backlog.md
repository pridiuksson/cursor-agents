# Multi-Agent AI Workflow Template - Public Roadmap & Vision

**What This Is**: A GitHub template repository that packages our battle-tested multi-agent AI development workflow, enabling teams to build production-grade software with systematic AI coordination.

**For Developers**: This roadmap shows our plan to deliver immediate value through a simple MVP, then iterate to full automation. Follow along or contribute!

**Structure**: MVP first for quick wins, then strategic context and future vision.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Part 1: The MVP - "Clone & Manually Configure" Template**

Our first release proves the core value of multi-agent coordination with minimal setup. Users manually configure via find-and-replace, but get to experience specialization, quality gates, two-tier memory, and code-first docs in action.

**Why Start Simple?**: Demonstrate the 'magic' of agents working as a team before adding automation. This builds understanding and demand.

### **MVP Success Criteria**
- GitHub template repo published with all files.
- `QUICK_START.md` enables 5-minute manual setup.
- Users complete the /user-profile example, seeing full agent coordination: planning, implementation, quality review, and documentation.
- Demo shows key features: specialization, quality gates catching issues, two-tier memory in action, code-first docs.
- Simple video/GIF walkthrough captures the 'Aha!' moment.
- Users can articulate why this beats single-agent approaches.

### **MVP Backlog**

#### **EPIC 1: Extract & Generalize Core Workflow Components**
**Goal**: Pull essential elements from our production system and make them template-ready.

- **STORY 1.1**: Extract core personas (system-architect.mdc, feature-dev.mdc, docs-writer.mdc, quality-reviewer.mdc) to .cursor/rules/agents/.
- **STORY 1.2**: Replace project-specific content with placeholders like {{PROJECT_NAME}}, {{PRIMARY_LANGUAGE}}, {{TEST_COMMAND}}.
- **STORY 1.3**: Create core-protocol.mdc in .cursor/rules/core with universal patterns (two-tier memory, code-first docs).
- **STORY 1.4**: Add basic quality gate templates (review prompts) to demonstrate systematic validation.

#### **EPIC 2: Build Lightning-Fast Onboarding Docs**
**Goal**: Create documentation that gets users productive immediately while teaching key concepts.

- **STORY 2.1**: Write QUICK_START.md as the friendly entry point, focused on quick wins and benefits.
- **STORY 2.2**: Add 'Manual Setup' section with step-by-step find-and-replace instructions.
- **STORY 2.3**: Create ARCHITECTURE.md template explaining core principles with examples.
- **STORY 2.4**: Include 'Agent Decision Flowchart' in QUICK_START.md to guide when to use each agent.

#### **EPIC 3: Create Compelling 'Hello Agents' Demo**
**Goal**: Build an example that showcases full workflow value without overwhelming complexity.

- **STORY 3.1**: Create /example directory with 'add /user-profile endpoint' task, including starter code, expected output, and deliberate 'bugs' for quality gate demo.
- **STORY 3.2**: Add tutorial in QUICK_START.md walking through agent coordination to complete the task.
- **STORY 3.3**: Document handoffs, showing how quality reviewer catches issues and enforces patterns.
- **STORY 3.4**: Embed short video/GIF demonstrating the full cycle, highlighting key features.

## ðŸ§  **Part 2: Why This Workflow Changes Everything**

This is our 'long-term memory' - the principles making this system superior to single-agent AI coding.

### **The Vision: Production-Grade AI Development**
We've engineered an AI workflow that produces reliable, secure code at scale. This template lets you experience:
- **Specialized Agents**: Right AI for each task (e.g., planning vs. coding vs. reviewing).
- **Built-in Quality Gates**: Systematic checks preventing common AI failures.
- **Resilient Documentation**: Code-first approach that stays accurate as projects evolve.
- **Proven Benefits**: Higher quality, fewer bugs, easier maintenance.

### **Core Patterns You'll Love**
1. **Two-Tier Memory**: Stable docs for 'why' + live code for 'how' = Smarter AI decisions.
2. **Code-First Docs**: Searchable patterns keep documentation fresh and useful.
3. **Agent Decision Matrix**: Quick guide for orchestration.

| Task Type | Primary Agent | Quality Gate | Benefit |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| Feature Planning | System Architect | Review plan | Strategic alignment |
| Implementation | Feature Developer | Code review | Clean execution |
| Validation | Quality Reviewer | Tests/security check | Catches issues early |
| Documentation | Docs Writer | Accuracy validation | Maintainable knowledge |

## ðŸ”® **Part 3: Exciting Roadmap Ahead**

After MVP validation, we'll add polish and power:

### **Phase 2: Smart Automation**
**CLI Setup Tool**: npx command for interactive configuration.
**Validation Scripts**: Automated checks for workflow health.

### **Phase 3: Community & Enterprise**
**Plugins**: Community extensions for tech stacks/industries.
**Migration Tools**: Easy adoption for existing projects.

Join us in building the future of AI development!
